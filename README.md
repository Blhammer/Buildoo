# Buildoo: Place where you can find any services

The main goal of this application is to help users to find, create or share the services with their friends or relatives if they need.
Before users create their accounts they can have a look at all the services, our team, prices and our blog. Once created an account,
they will be able to create their service, like and dislike someone's service and post a comment. After you like some service you can
find the liked services in Liked Page. You can see all created services by you in My Services Page. There is an admin page but you have to
be set as admin.

The web application has been built with MERN full-stack and it has been deployed with Heroku.
